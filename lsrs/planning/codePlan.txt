Main - makes sure the code isn't running when it's not supposed to. it should just launch the InitializeDeinitialize, that, in turn, should prepare the world and then create, save or load a game.
When the world is created and the game is loaded, you can start booking the events.

	InitializeDeinitialize - applies all of the mod's settings (Pedestrians on street, custom police, game's time), and removes them, may be incorporated into CreateSaveLoad
	CreateSaveLoad - create a game, save it, and load it.
		CreatePlayerAvatar - Create the player's avatar.
	
	PoliceManager - manages heat levels and custom police cars
	
	UIMenu - A script to manage the menu
		FreeEvent - setup a free event. Separately from normal game?
		CareerMode - the simulated world
			CarPurchaserPlayer - the script that manually exchanges cars for money for the player
			CreateTeamPlayer - this allows the player to create and destroy their own Teams
			ManageTeamPlayer - this allows the player to manage, recruit for  teams
			EventManager - puts the player into the event at the exact time, lets player to skip to the next event, allow players to book events or to create events.
				

			TimeAdvancer - this script must activate when the clock hits the right time, chain activating the simulator and all of the scripts below this.
				EventSimulator - simulates all of the events in which the player hasn't been racing, over the last timeframe
